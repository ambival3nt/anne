<h3><i>A discord bot with a web-based UI</i></h3>
</center>

Disdain, eventually, will (and for some, already does) include:
- Laravel-powered backend
- Web-based multi-tenant dashboard
- An interface to modify, create and delete commands while the bot is active from the web UI
- OpenAI-powered dialogue and features
- Roles for users
- Webserver-hosting capable
